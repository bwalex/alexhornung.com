I'm an electronic engineer living in the UK. I mainly do digital hardware
design, in particular processors, but have significant experience in software,
too, especially in kernel development.

I am a big fan of open source, both software and hardware. Throughout the years
I've contributed a large amount of code to open source projects. I am also a
committer at the [DragonFly BSD Project][dragonfly]. Occasionally you
might see me giving talks on DragonFly BSD, such as on the photo to the right.

You'll find a number of my own projects on here or on my [github page][github].
