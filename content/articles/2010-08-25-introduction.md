Welcome to my new page and blog. I'm an Electronic Engineer but currently do more Software than Hardware. The blog is mainly intended to be a space where I can place all my thoughts and rumblings, as well as share my 
experience on certain, mostly technical subjects. As you can see from the 'About' page or the 'DragonFly' page, I'm a DragonFly BSD committer as well as a Freelance software developer.

DragonFly BSD is of course more of a hobby, but it's definitely a worthwhile one. It was forked back in the day from FreeBSD 4.X and has since developed its own personality. I enjoy working on it as I like to stick to 
low level software if anything.... the DragonFly kernel is my playground and I really try to stay away from most of the userland, except for some kernel <-> userland interfaces. Expect the occasional post about recent 
DragonFly development!

In my free time I also enjoy doing Electronics, usually involving microcontrollers (PICmicro or Atmel) and nowadays FPGAs, too. I'll hopefully be posting some of my designs as well as other ideas on this page soon.
