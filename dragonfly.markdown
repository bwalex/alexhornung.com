I've been a [DragonFly BSD][dragonfly] committer since mid 2009, and have since contributed to several parts of the OS,
mostly to the kernel and drivers as can be seen in the non-exhaustive list below.
If you want to contact me regarding anything DragonFly related, I suggest you do so by sending me an
 email to alexh (at) dragonflybsd (dot) org.

If you want me to work on a specific area or require some functionality that is currently not present,
you can sponsor me to do so; contact me for further details.
