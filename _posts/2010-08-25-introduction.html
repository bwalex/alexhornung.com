<p style="text-align: justify; ">Welcome to my new page and blog. I&#39;m an Electronic Engineer but currently do more Software than Hardware. The blog is mainly intended to be a space where I can place all my thoughts and rumblings, as well as share my experience on certain, mostly technical subjects. As you can see from the &#39;<a href="http://www.alexhornung.com/about/">About</a>&#39; page or the &#39;<a href="http://www.alexhornung.com/dragonfly/">DragonFly</a>&#39; page, I&#39;m a <a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org">DragonFly BSD</a> committer&nbsp;as well as a Freelance software developer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">DragonFly BSD is of course more of a hobby, but it&#39;s definitely a worthwhile one. It was forked back in the day from FreeBSD 4.X and has since developed its own personality. I enjoy working on it as I like to stick to low level software if anything.... the DragonFly kernel is my playground and I really try to stay away from most of the userland, except for some kernel &lt;-&gt; userland interfaces. Expect the occasional post about recent DragonFly development!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">In my free time I also enjoy doing Electronics, usually involving microcontrollers (PICmicro or Atmel) and nowadays FPGAs, too. I&#39;ll hopefully be posting some of my designs as well as other ideas on this page soon.</p>
